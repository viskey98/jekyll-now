### More about me 
I love solving problems, let it be real life, coding contest or bug in a software, I relish solving them.

I believe that cyber-security is very crucial in this cyber-world. I work on playing my part to track down maliciousness, fix the flaws in the system and enhance the cyber-security.

In my free time I watch Korean TV series, listen to k-pop music or play PC games.
