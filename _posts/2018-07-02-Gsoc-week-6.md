This is the seventh week of `GSoc 2018`

# Report
This week I have worked on the following:
- Minor fixes on the tanner side after latest tanner update.
- Few integration tests on tanner-develop.

Next week I will be migrating tanner from `asyncio_redis` to `aioredis` ([issue](https://github.com/mushorg/tanner/issues/259)).
And after that perform integration tests on tanner, so that we can make a new release on both snare and tanner's side. :)
