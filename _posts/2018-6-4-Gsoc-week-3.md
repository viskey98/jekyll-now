This is the third week of `GSoc 2018`

# Report
This week I have completed the last steps of [SNARE](http://github.com/mushorg/snare) reconstruction.

* Step 4:
Setup structure for snare
	* Create setup.py

* Step 5: 
Reconstruct cloner ([merged](https://github.com/mushorg/snare/pull/141))
	* Re-write cloner to latest aiohttp sytax
	* Move cloner to setup structure
 
* Step 6: 
Re-write tests ([merged](https://github.com/mushorg/snare/pull/142))

    * Re-write all unittests to be compatible with latest snare update.

At this point, snare reconstruction is finally completed
*and we are on track with the proposal timeline :)*
