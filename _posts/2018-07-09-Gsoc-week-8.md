This is the eighth week of `GSoc 2018`

# Report
This week I have worked on the following:
- Migrating tanner from `asyncio_redis` to `aioredis` [(merged)](https://github.com/mushorg/tanner/pull/260)
- Fix attack requests from snare-develop. [(PR)](https://github.com/mushorg/snare/pull/149)
- Remove redis duplicate sessions in tanner-develop.
- Few integration tests on tanner and snare (develop sides).

  Next week there will be *2nd evaluation.* I will try to perform few more tests, fix issues and make a new release. And continue
  taking up tasks from the proposal :)
