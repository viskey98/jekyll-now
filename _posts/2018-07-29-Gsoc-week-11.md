This is the eleventh week of `GSoc 2018`

# Report
This week:
- I have run automated HTTP-fingerprinting on SNARE and evalutated the results.
- Few minor errors which seemed to be unavoidable for the moment were left as they were.

Next week I shall work on improving TANNERweb-UI and creating a commands manual for the same :)
