title: GSoC week-6

This is the sixth week of `GSoc 2018`

# Report
This week I have implemented the following:
- Implement the heuristic detection approach [(merged)](https://github.com/mushorg/tanner/pull/256)
  - This was the approach deduced after research done in the previous week.
- Improve crawler user-agent and host-name list.
  - Data used to improve this list was obtained from [source](https://myip.ms/browse/web_bots/Known_Web_Bots_Web_Bots_2018_Web_Spider_List.html).

Next test I shall perform few integration tests on tanner's develop side and continue the tasks as per proposal :)
