This is the fourth week of `GSoc 2018`

# Report
This week I started with, trying to move [SNARE](https://github.com/mushorg/snare) and [TANNER](https://github.com/viskey98/tanner) to [landscape.io](https://landscape.io), due to their server-side problems and mentor's advice
this task was dropped.
The next task according to the proposal was taken up.
- Implement 'location' stats in tanner sessions. [(merged)](https://github.com/mushorg/tanner/pull/252)
- Do research for improving choose_possible_owner function of TANNER.

The next week I shall continue doing some research and then try to improve that functionality if possible.
