This is the tenth week of `GSoc 2018`

# Report
This week I have implemented authorization for TANNER-API server.[(merged)](https://github.com/mushorg/tanner/pull/268)
- JWT tokens used as API_KEYS.
- Each token is verified on every api request made.
- Each tanner owner can use their own desired signature for api verification.

Next week I shall work on HTTP-fingerprinting on snare's side and evaluate the performance :)
