This is the fifth week of `GSoc 2018`

# Report
This week I continued the research on crawler, attacker and tool detection.
I came up with heuristic approach for detection of the possible owners based on this [article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228947708_A_Heuristic-Regression_Approach_to_Crawler_Pattern_Identification_on_Clickstream_Data).
The new approach deals with giving cf ( Confidence factor) value for each of the possible owner type. This was assigned from trees based on the above mentioned
heuristic approach.
Two trees were drawn, one for crawler+tool detection and other for attacker detection. And a mathematical equation for detection of user was
also derived.
This concept will improve the analyzing of [TANNER](https://github.com/mushorg/tanner) into a consistent one and the tree structure gives it sustainability.

The next week I shall implement this approach and also continue with the next tasks. :)
